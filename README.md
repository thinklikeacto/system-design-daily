# system-design-daily

This repository contains a collection of system design projects created to practice and explore real-world architecture and scalability challenges.

Each project is structured around a practical use case inspired by popular systems like Bitly, WhatsApp, Uber, Netflix, and others.

The goal is to provide simple yet expandable examples for anyone who wants to learn system design and backend development by building hands-on projects.
